This project focuses on analyzing fielding performance in a T20 cricket match using ball-by-ball data for three players. The dataset was manually collected, cleaned, and structured to evaluate key fielding metrics such as success rate, errors, total chances, and runs saved. An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize player-wise .

*Analyze fielding contributions of individual players

*Identify strengths and areas of improvement

*Compare performance using KPIs and visualizations

*Support data-driven fielding placement decisions
